        <h1>About</h1>
        Abtein is ultimately just a dude who loves makings beats. From a young age he started playing piano and eventually picked up the drums.

        Life has a funny way of twisting and turning and at some point in life music was absent from his life. In his late 20's he realized something 
        was missing and decided to get back into music the only way he knew how. Finding inspiration from attending music festivals and witnessing masterfully crafted electronic
        music sets Abtein decided to get back into the game with making beats. This eventually led him back to picking up piano and drums and ultimately returning to school for music.
        Abtein strives to create one of a kind experiences for live audiences that can only be achieved with a combination of electronica and live performance.
